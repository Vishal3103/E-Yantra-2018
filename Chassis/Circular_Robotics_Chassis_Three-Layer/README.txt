# Summary

Circular Robotics Chassis Kit (Three-Layer) similar to Adafruit and Sparkfun 

1st layer (Base) has tabs to mount continuous server

2nd (Mid) and 3rd (Top) layer has no tabs so you can place components such as battery, bread board, etc. using some sort of adhesive tape

Standoffs are from McMaster Carr . The holes on 1st,2nd, and 3rd layer were not placed with exact dimensions but will work with 4/40 screws so make sure your standoff do not use anything bigger than 4/40 screws

There are two type of wheels. One you must push onto the servo gear and secure using a screw. This is a bit wobbly so I made a second option that slides onto the 4 point horn which is much more aligned. So basically you place the horn on the servo, place the wheel on the horn, ans secure it using a screw.
